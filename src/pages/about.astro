  <h2>👨‍💻 Who I Am</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Alan Zheng, a passionate software engineer with a deep fascination for
    emerging technologies that are reshaping our digital landscape. My journey
    in tech has led me to specialize in areas where innovation meets practical
    application: cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, Web3, and
    decentralized storage systems.
  </p>

  <h2>🚀 What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    My expertise spans across multiple domains of modern software engineering. I
    architect and build scalable cloud infrastructure that can handle
    enterprise-grade workloads, develop AI-powered applications that solve
    real-world problems, and create decentralized systems that contribute to the
    future of the internet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> I design and implement robust, scalable
    systems using Kubernetes, Terraform, and major cloud providers. My focus is on
    creating infrastructure that's not just scalable, but also cost-effective and
    maintainable.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> I work with large language models,
    machine learning pipelines, and AI-driven automation to create intelligent systems
    that can process, analyze, and understand data at scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Web3 & IPFS:</strong> I'm actively involved in building the decentralized
    web, working with IPFS for distributed storage, smart contracts, and blockchain
    technologies that enable new paradigms of digital ownership and interaction.
  </p>

  <h2>💭 My Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that the best technology is invisible – it works seamlessly,
    scales effortlessly, and empowers users without getting in their way.
    Whether I'm optimizing a Kubernetes cluster, training an AI model, or
    deploying a smart contract, my goal is always to create solutions that are
    both technically excellent and genuinely useful.
  </p>

  <h2>🌟 Beyond Code</h2>
  <p>
    When I'm not architecting systems or experimenting with the latest AI
    models, I enjoy staying at the forefront of technological innovation. I'm
    constantly learning about new developments in quantum computing, exploring
    novel blockchain consensus mechanisms, and contributing to open-source
    projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm always excited to collaborate on challenging projects, discuss emerging
    technologies, or help solve complex technical problems. Feel free to reach
    out if you'd like to connect!
